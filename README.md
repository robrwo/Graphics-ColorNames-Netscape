# NAME

Graphics::ColorNames::Netscape - Netscape 1.1 Color Names

# VERSION

version v3.1.3

# SYNOPSIS

```
require Graphics::ColorNames::Netscape;

$NameTable = Graphics::ColorNames::Netscape->NamesRgbTable();
$RgbBlack  = $NameTable->{black};
```

# DESCRIPTION

This module defines color names and their associated RGB values associated
with Netscape 1.1 (I cannot determine whether they were once usable in
Netscape or were arbitrary names for RGB values-- _many of these names are
not recognized by later versions of Netscape_).

This scheme is deprecated, but is provided as a separate release
from [Graphics::ColorNames](https://metacpan.org/pod/Graphics::ColorNames) for backwards compatability.
